            <h3>Jul 2018 - Present (4 years 11 months)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>As the most Senior UI/UX Designer at Tapptitude, a product studio, I led a team of 5 UI Designers
                    and
                    worked with multinational clients all over the world for 4 years. During this time, I honed my
                    skills in
                    design strategy, user research, and prototyping.
                </li>
                <li>I led the design process for various products, including mobile apps, web applications, and
                    e-commerce
                    platforms. I also collaborated with cross-functional teams, including developers, product managers,
                    and clients, to ensure that the designs met the client's requirements and delivered a seamless user
                    experience.
                </li>
                <li>One of the most memorable projects I worked on was a mobile app for a travel company. The project
                    involved extensive user research and testing to ensure that the design met the needs of both the
                    client
                    and the end-users. I led the team of designers and worked closely with developers to deliver a
                    highquality design that met the client's requirements and delivered an exceptional user experience.
                </li>
                <li>Throughout my time at Tapptitude, I also had the opportunity to develop my skills in project
                    management, communication, and collaboration. I worked closely with clients to understand their
                    needs
                    and goals, and with cross-functional teams to ensure that the projects were completed on time and on
                    budget.</li>
                <li>Overall, my experience at Tapptitude was challenging, yet rewarding. I had the opportunity to work
                    on
                    a wide range of projects, lead a team of talented designers, and develop my skills in user
                    experience
                    design. The experience has prepared me well for future career endeavors in the field of UX design.

            <h3>Dec 2013 - Jan 2017 (3 years 2 months)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>As a UX Designer at Slick - UI/UX Design Agency for 3 years, I had the opportunity to work on a wide
                    range of projects for clients across various industries. During my time there, I honed my skills in
                    user
                    research, information architecture, and prototyping.</li>
                <li>One of the most memorable projects I worked on was a redesign of a healthcare app for a major
                    client.
                    The project involved extensive user research and testing to ensure that the design met the needs of
                    both the client and the end-users. I collaborated closely with a team of designers and developers to
                    create a design that was visually appealing, easy to use, and met all of the client's requirements.
                </li>
                <li>In addition to app design, I also worked on website redesigns, mobile app designs, and e-commerce
                    experiences for various clients. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure that the
                    designs
                    met the client's goals and delivered an exceptional user experience.</li>
                <li>One of the most challenging projects I worked on was a mobile app design for a startup company with
                    a tight deadline. I had to work efficiently while still delivering a high-quality design that met
                    the client's
                    requirements</li>
                <li>Throughout my time at Slick - UI/UX Design Agency, I also had the opportunity to develop my skills
                    in
                    project management, communication, and collaboration. I worked closely with clients to understand
                    their needs and goals, and with cross-functional teams to ensure that the projects were completed on
                    time and on budget.
                </li>
                <li>Overall, my experience at Slick - UI/UX Design Agency was challenging, yet rewarding. I had the
                    opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, collaborate with talented designers and developers,
                    and develop my skills in user experience design. The experience has prepared me well for future
                    career
                    endeavors in the field of UX design.
